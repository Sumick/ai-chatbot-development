# AI Chatbot Development

## Project Overview

Develop a prototype AI chatbot that utilizes generative AI techniques to interact with users and provide helpful responses based on user queries.

## Tasks

1. **Model Design**: Design an AI model for natural language processing using either TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model should be capable of understanding and generating human-like text responses. Outline your model architecture, including the choice of layers, activation functions, and any pre-trained models you plan to use.

2. **Data Analysis**: Perform data analysis on a provided dataset of user queries and responses. Summarize insights that will inform your chatbot's ability to understand context and intent. Use Python libraries such as Pandas or NumPy to analyze the dataset. Present your findings and the implications for the chatbot design.

3. **Cloud Deployment**: Set up the project in a cloud computing environment (Azure or Google Cloud Platform) for deployment. Configure the necessary services required to host your AI model and chatbot. Provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up the environment, including Docker configurations and any cloud services used.

4. **Deployment and Testing**: Demonstrate the deployment of your chatbot and conduct testing to ensure it operates as expected. Include details on performance metrics and possible improvements. Use unit testing frameworks such as pytest. Provide a report on test results, including any issues identified and how they were addressed.
